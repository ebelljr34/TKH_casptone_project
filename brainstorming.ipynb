      "{'title': 'Software Engineer - All levels', 'company_name': 'Bubble', 'location': 'New York, NY, USA', 'via': 'via Angel.co', 'description': \"For 95% of programming jobs, the primary focus is on using abstractions. For instance, using React JS to build a responsive web portal, or hammering out an API in Express or Rocket. They are about taking ways of seeing the world that others have invented, and applying them to the task at hand.\\n\\nWe value and respect this work, and our jobs involve a fair share of it, but we are looking for engineers who get up in the morning for the other 5%.\\n\\nWe want the abstraction creators: the engineers who are more excited about the technology that doesn’t exist yet than the technology that does.\\n\\nWe want people who are dreaming about creating new programming languages or operating system kernels, or even just small NPM packages with APIs that better reflect the problem space than prior abstractions.\\n\\nWe need this because the business Bubble is in is taking common patterns for constructing software, and capturing those patterns in repeatable technology, so that they become accessible and intuitive... via our visual language. We are in the business of figuring out how to let our users express what they want to create as simply and directly as possible, and then solving the hard problems of taking what they express and running it performantly, scalably, and securely in the cloud.\\n\\nIn addition to creating better abstractions, the other pole of Bubble's business is helping our users solve their problems. Our users build everything from community projects to VC-backed startups. We are often a critical part of our customers’ operations. As a Bubble engineer, you get a direct feedback loop with customers: our community is incredibly vocal, and whenever we announce a release on our community forum, it always sparks feedback and engagement, and often celebration.\\n\\nSo, the other thing we look for and value in our hiring process is people who love to ship code and see it impact people's lives. We live in a dynamic tension between passionate love for technology in its pure form, and pragmatic caring for the end product. That tension is our secret sauce: the constant back-and-forth between solving the customer problem, and designing the right long-term solution is what's led to a product that people tell us literally changed their lives (read our last fundraising announcement, and our community's reaction to it).\\n\\nWe have a number of hard problems we are trying to solve:\\n• Ensuring user-written queries get compiled into scalable, high-performant SQL\\n• Building tooling to help users secure their applications\\n• Evolving our core language from being an interpreter to more of a compiler to enable faster page loads\\n• Making Bubble easier to learn and more powerful by taking common user pain points and converting them into new language features\\n\\nWe are looking for experienced programmers excited to help us tackle them. The ideal candidate loves solving hard technical problems to achieve a business goal, and has invested in their craft with a diversity of experiences.\\n\\nBecause we are hiring programmers to design and implement a new language, we don't have any hard requirements about what technologies you need to know coming in. Familiarity with our stack is helpful, but don’t hesitate to apply if you haven’t worked with all of these:\\n• AWS\\n• Postgres\\n• Redis\\n• Node\\n• Coffee-Script\\n• ES6\\n\\nWe look for the following in candidates:\\n• Goal orientation, and ability to find pragmatic solutions to hard problems\\n• Strong communication skills: we believe that the ability to explain your work to others is important\\n• Experience writing high-quality production code: ideally at least 1 - 2 years of professional experience, or multiple internships at startups or companies with strong tech cultures\\n• Diversity of technical background: we like candidates who have worked with multiple languages and problem spaces, because we think that breadth of experience makes it easier to see multiple potential solutions to a problem\\n• Alignment with our values: desire to empower others, a focus on team and user success over individual achievement, and transparency and willingness to admit mistakes and failures.\\n\\nWe think Bubble is amazing, but we also think we have an incredibly long way to go. Our aim is huge: we are trying to replace the entire traditional engineering stack. As such, we think that we are going to continually build and rebuild our systems as we scale up: we have a limitless well of engineering challenges ahead of us to create the platform we envision. If you are passionate about creating technological leverage for people, and the idea of an early-but-growing startup whose main obstacle to success is our ability to solve hard engineering problems is exciting, we look forward to hearing from you!\\n\\nNote: at this time, we are only considering candidates who are authorized to work in the US (if you have an OPT or a current H1B, please apply!)\\n\\nBubble focuses on SaaS, Databases, Web Development, and Programming. Their company has offices in New York City. They have a small team that's between 11-50 employees. To date, Bubble has raised $6.25M of funding; their latest round was closed on June 2019.\\n\\nYou can view their website at https://bubble.io/ or find them on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Product Hunt\", 'extensions': ['Over 1 month ago', 'Full–time'], 'detected_extensions': {'posted_at': 'Over 1 month ago', 'schedule_type': 'Full–time'}, 'job_id': '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'}\n",

We've been building together since 2016 and are trusted by customers including Nike, Airbnb, Slack, Samsung, and more. We're excited to be growing a team as diverse and creative as the millions of people we reach worldwide, and a company where everyone can thrive.\\n\\nAbout The Role:\\n\\nRemember the first time you solved a problem by programming? The delight and excitement you felt when it finally...worked? We want to deliver that experience to everyone by giving them the building blocks to create useful tools of all kinds—without needing to code. That's been the vision of computing pioneers since the 70s. Today, all the infrastructure is present, but we need your engineering to pull it off. We're excited to be opening up a brand new office in New York City, and we'd love for you to join us!\\n\\nWhat You'll Do:\\n• You'll work with others to build new... product features from start to finish: through conception, research, implementation, and maintenance. For example, you might build an editor for inline mathematical equations.\\n• You'll help improve performance and reliability, or polish existing features. For example, you might make it easier to select text across multiple paragraphs.\\n• You'll build internal tools to support simplicity and productivity for the whole team. This might include writing a script to import user feedback into Notion.\\n\\nWhat We're Looking For:\\n• Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.\\n• Shipping quality user interfaces: You can work with others to build and maintain quality user interfaces for a big audience, using Web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a modern UI framework like React. If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus.\\n• Familiarity with the backend: You understand how parts of a system fit together—from the user interface to the data model. Experienced candidates should be familiar with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL.\\n• Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about the business impact of what you're building, and you prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.\\n• Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.\\n• Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.\\n• Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.\\n• Team player: You understand when work is better, together. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.\\n\\nBonus Points:\\n• You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.\\n• You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.\\n• You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.\\n\\nOur customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our enthusiasm for small businesses, you will find a home at Notion.\\n\\nNotion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.

That’s our heritage as a disruptive company — as a company whose future depends on our capacity to innovate with a sense of drive, purpose and urgency. If you join Built In, you will work from this set of values:\\nBe Unreasonably Passionate. Our passion is borderline obsessive, and we’re ok with that. No one ever built anything great on a “meh.” We work with outsized passion to fulfill our mission.\\nBe Humble. You don’t have all the answers. Luckily, you don’t have to. Don’t worry about being right. Be humble instead.\\nStay Curious. Curiosity is a springboard to the future. It can transform the wisp of an idea into a breakthrough. We ask “what if.” We work with wonder. It’s how we innovate.\\nLead with Solutions. Question everything. But offer solutions as you do. Raise issues. But propose a few answers. For every hole you poke, offer a way to patch it up.\\nOwn the Result. We have no time for blame or shame. When you stumble, own it, learn from it + get back to business.\\nDo More. Do more than your job description. Take initiative. Take charge. No job is beneath you, and no job is too big. Be a leader and do more — do whatever it takes.\\nBe Inclusive, Always. We’re committed to a culture where all people are respected, have a say and can be their whole selves. We will uplift and advocate for one another. Always.\\nResearch shows that women and other marginalized groups tend to apply to roles only when they check every point on a job description. We encourage you to apply if you meet the majority of qualifications and this role is aligned with your career trajectory.\\nBuilt In is an equal employment opportunity employer. Qualified candidates are considered for employment without regard to race, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, age, military or veteran status, disability, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law.\\nBuilt In is guided by principles of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).

For example, you might make it easier to select text across multiple paragraphs.\\n• You'll build internal tools to support simplicity and productivity for the whole team. This might include writing a script to import user feedback into Notion.\\n\\nWhat We're Looking For:\\n• Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.\\n• Shipping quality user interfaces: You can work with others to build and maintain quality user interfaces for a big audience, using Web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a modern UI framework like React. If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus.\\n• Familiarity with the backend: You understand how parts of a system fit together—from the user interface to the data model. Experienced candidates should be familiar with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL.\\n• Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about the business impact of what you're building, and you prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.\\n• Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.\\n• Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.\\n• Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.\\n• Team player: You understand when work is better, together. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.\\n\\nBonus Points:\\n• You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.\\n• You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.\\n• You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.\\n\\nOur customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our enthusiasm for small businesses, you will find a home at Notion.\\n\\nNotion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.

Teams of all scales — from the world’s largest public companies to the smallest of startups — use Slack to get work done, so we take performance and reliability very seriously. A taste of our scale:\\n• The average user spends over 10 hours connected and 2.5 hours active in Slack every single day\\n• 1.5 billion+ messages are sent per month, half of those outside the United States\\n• Every day we see over 10M+ daily active users, over a billion web requests, and 10s of billions of database queries.\\n\\nFor millions of people, Slack is the primary communication tool they use at work all day long. They expect it to be exceptionally reliable and fast, all the time.\\n\\nInfrastructure at Slack\\n\\nWe operate at tremendous scale with systems that process millions of events per second. Our team maintains and builds the lower levels of our stack, including:\\n• Edge... services\\n• Data Stores and Caches\\n• Real-time messaging\\n• Asynchronous background job processing\\n\\nWe know we’ve done our job correctly when none of our users think about us. We don’t typically ship new user-facing features, but rather ensure our systems are incredibly performant, highly available, reliable, and scalable. In other words, Slack just works seamlessly.\\n\\nSlack's API and web backend is built on PHP/Hack, our backend services are written in Java and Go, and we use Vitess as our storage engine. Our architecture is constantly evolving to handle millions more users. You can read about how we scaled our datastores with Vitess, how we respond to incidents, and much more on our blog.\\n\\nOur Team\\n\\nSlack's Datastores team builds and operates the database platform powering Slack. We write software to manage thousands of stateful hosts, providing several petabytes of online database capacity. We are building one of the fastest-growing database platforms in the world. Our MySQL databases run in Vitess. You can read more about our migration to Vitess at: Scaling Datastores at Slack with Vitess\\n\\nIf you were to join Slack, here the types of things you would do over the course of a typical week:\\n• Operate and enhance our large, highly-available database infrastructure, utilizing technologies such as MySQL and Vitess.\\n• Develop tools to enable self-service and self-managing capabilities of our database infrastructure so that other teams can operate full-stack while rapidly building new features for our customers.\\n• Collaborate with engineering teams on their database storage needs, and advise them throughout the development lifecycle.\\n• Write code to capture database performance, and create tools and dashboards to provide actionable insight into that data.\\n• Participate in our on-call rotation and collaborate with our operations team to triage and resolve production issues.\\n• Support FedRAMP and DoD SRG activities.\\n\\nYou may be a fit for this role if you:\\n• Have lawful permanent residency within the U.S.\\n• Have been working in Database, Site Reliability Engineering, or infrastructure-owning teams with increasing responsibilities for 5+ years.\\n• Have professional experience using Python, Ruby, Go, or Java\\n• Operated at least one distributed data storage system, at scale and in a team environment. Some examples include: a relational database like MySQL, a search engine like Solr, or a streaming message bus like Kafka.\\n• Deployed server software on Linux, and then operated it at scale. You’ve debugged its problems, and analyzed and optimized its performance.\\n• Are familiar with deployment automation/configuration management tools like Chef, Ansible, Puppet, or Terraform.\\n• Have experience operating cloud infrastructure, especially AWS.\\n• Are a very strong communicator. You’re excited to explain complex technical concepts and share your knowledge with different audiences.\\n• Write code that can be easily understood by others with an eye towards clarity and maintainability.\\n• Are curious how things work; when they break you are eager and able to help fix them.\\n\\nInfrastructure is a diverse and inclusive team that treats their colleagues exceptionally well. We are happy to help you learn what you need to know; we encourage and support each other’s growth and thus it’s not expected that you would have expertise across all of these areas.\\n\\nCome join us!\\n\\nSlack is registered as an employer in many, but not all, states.
