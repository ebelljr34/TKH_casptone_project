# Employment Trends Dashboard - THE KNOWLEDGE HOUSE

# Problem Statement 
The Knowledge House, Inc.(TKH) needs to choose which resources they will have available for their alumni. For this project, the primary focus was 
to analyze and evaluate data to help fellows and alumni entering the current job market. TKH will create events, programming, and resources their
alumni need based on participants’ needs and economic and employment trends provided in our analysis.
  
The technology field is rapidly changing. Therefore, TKH needs timely information to make decisions for TKH and the resources they will provide their students and alumni. Our dashboard will reduce the time TKH and alumni spend searching for available resources and current hiring trends. It takes time to find, verify, synthesize, and analyze the data. Many fellows may not know where to find the information or what to focus on because they are new to this industry’s job market. We will be analyzing the data from multiple resources and saving their valuable time and personal resources.
